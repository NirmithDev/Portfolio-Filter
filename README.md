#### Why did you create this Nirmith???
- Because I wanted to update my personal website but I wanted to create a tester for it so yes.

#### How did you solve this??
- Initially I went to tutorial hell and was like what on earth is going on then I found nick's vid (link:*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be2tYHbvSyg*)
- Here I got what I wanted but I wanted to try my own since *practice helps make perfect*
- then I went forward and encountered a couple of issues thankfully Nick's video helped so credit is where credit's due

#### What did I learn??
- margin : 0 auto is the OG centering line ever lol JK JK ðŸ˜†
- I learnt and advanced my knowledge in DOM Manipulation
